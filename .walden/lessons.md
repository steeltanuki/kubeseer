### 2026-08-01T09:14:17Z | kubeseer-api-foundation | tasks
- Trigger: Initial task validation after requirements and design approval reported missing coverage from the placeholder scaffold
- Lesson: A valid scaffold becomes incomplete as soon as approved upstream documents introduce the real requirement set
- Guardrail: Before opening task review, require both task_reference_coverage and proof_reference_coverage to be complete in walden validate --json
### 2026-08-01T09:31:49Z | kubeseer-api-foundation | execute
- Trigger: Initial task 1.1 proof exposed non-semantic test assumptions
- Lesson: A JSON round-trip test compared metav1.Time locations and a pointer to an empty result struct by identity, causing false failures despite semantic preservation
- Guardrail: Compare Kubernetes time values by instant and test deep-copy isolation only through mutable fields; do not use pointer identity for zero-size structs
